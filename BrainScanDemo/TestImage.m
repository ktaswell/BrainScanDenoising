function [N, D, snrN, snrD] = TestImage(I)
% TestSlice - Tests a single 2D image for accuracy of denoising via Optimal
% Hard Thresholding.
%
%       Inputs:
%           I - 2D image matrix of intensity values
%       
%       Outputs:
%           N - Noisey 2D image matrix of I with gaussian noise added
%           D - Denoised 2D image matrix of N with Optimal Hard
%           Thresholding
%           snrN - Signal to Noise Ratio of Noisey 2D Image matrix
%           snrD - Signal to Noise Ratio of Denoised 2D Image matrix
